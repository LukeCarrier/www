In late 2019 I got very big on personal knowledge management (thank you, [Kevin](https://www.kevinslin.com/)!) and began sharing much of my learning and thinking publicly on the Internet. I'd hoped that some of the technical learnings might help save others some troubleshooting time.

In the AI age, I'm no longer comfortable sharing this content publicly to have it stolen for the production of frontier models that are rented out to others.

If you followed a link here, please reach email me (my name at family domain) and I'll gladly help you out.
